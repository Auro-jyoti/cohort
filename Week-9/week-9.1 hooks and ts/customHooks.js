// Hooks that you create Yourself, so other people can use Them are called custom hooks.

// A custom hook is effectively a function, but with the following propoerties : 

// 1. Uses another hook internally (useState, useEffect, another custom Hook)

// 2. Starts with use

// A few good examples of this can be

// 1. Data fetching hooks
// 2. Browser functionality related hooks - useOnlineStatus, useWindowSize, useMousePosition
// 3. Performance/ Time based - useInterval, useDebounce.
