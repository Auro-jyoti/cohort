# Document Object Model (DOM) Introduction

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** serves as a powerful interface for representing and manipulating HTML documents in memory. It provides a structured tree-like representation of web pages, allowing programs to dynamically alter document structure, style, and content.

## Key Concepts

- The DOM is not a programming language but a versatile interface for web documents.
- It represents a page as nodes and objects, forming a tree-like structure.
- The DOM is loaded into the browser as a crucial component for JavaScript to interact with HTML and SVG documents.
- Without the DOM, JavaScript wouldn't have a model for web pages.

## Web APIs and DOM

- Web APIs are essential tools for constructing web content and applications.
- Scripts, whether inline or included, grant immediate access to the document or window objects' APIs for document manipulation.
- The DOM was intentionally designed to be language-agnostic, ensuring a consistent API for document representation.

## Browser Rendering

- When a browser parses an HTML document, it constructs a DOM Tree that acts as a blueprint for rendering the document.
- This tree serves as the foundation for web page display and interactivity.
